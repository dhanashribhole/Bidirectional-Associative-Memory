# Bidirectional Associative Memory Network to recognize characters

Bidirectional associative memory (BAM) is a recurrent network. It consists of two layers and can realize the hetero-associative memory in which recalled patterns are different from triggering patterns.
In the C source file input matrix is of binary type where for 0 ,1 we have considered -1 ,1 respectively. Reconstruction of binary matrix has been found out, from which the most similar input gives less error rate while least similar gives high error rate.
